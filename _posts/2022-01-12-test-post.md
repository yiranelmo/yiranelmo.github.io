In this post, I will do some data visualization analysis on Palmer Penguins dataset.

## Loading Data
```python
# import required packages
import pandas as pd

# read dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Cleaning Data
```python
# clean data
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
penguins = penguins[penguins['Sex'] != '.']
```

## Packages Needed For Data Visualization
```python
# import required packages
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

## Data Visualization
### Data Visualization 1
```python
df = penguins.copy()

# select more important columns
columns = ["Species", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)",
           "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)", "Delta 15 N (o/oo)", 
           "Delta 13 C (o/oo)"]
           
# make a dataframe
dv_1 = pd.DataFrame(df, columns = columns)

# make the mean value table by using groupby
dv_1.groupby(["Species", "Sex"]).mean().round(2)
```

Some clear observations and patterns that we can see are:
- On average, Gentoo penguins tend to have the largest body mass and flipper length for both genders when compared to the other two species.
- Despite Gentoo penguins being the largest out of the three, the numbers suggests that they have the shortest culmen depth of the three species.
- On average, Adelie penguins are the smallest penguins with regards to body mass, flipper length, and their culmen length.

### Data Visualization 2
```python
# use seaborn package to create row of graphs

# x is Body Mass and y is Flipper Length
fgrid = sns.relplot(data = df, x = 'Body Mass (g)', y = 'Flipper Length (mm)',
hue = 'Species', col = 'Species', alpha = 0.7, aspect = 1.2, height = 4)
```

From previous summary table, we saw that there were patterns between these two variables and so, I created these graphs to further validate those observations. These graphs show an even clearer pattern between these two quantitative varibles and suggests that on average, Adelie penguins are the smallest penguins and Gentoo penguins are the largest penguins with regards to both body mass and culmen length.

### Data Visualization 3
```python
# create a plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)

# set xlabel, ylabel and title and then draws plot.
ax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Depth (gmm)',
ylabel = 'Frequency',
title = 'Histogram of Culmen Depth')
specie = set(df['Species'])

# for - loop for different species
for i in specie:
    distinct = df[df['Species'] == i]
    distinct = distinct['Culmen Depth (mm)'].dropna()
    ax.hist(distinct, label = i.split(' ')[0], alpha = 0.5)
ax.legend()
```

From the summary table, we observed that most of the Gentoo penguins had smaller culmen depths on average. Using this histogram, we can see that most of the Gentoo penguin data points lie around the lower culmen depths, which supports this observation. Culmen depth may be a strong indicator that differentiates Gentoo penguins from other species. Furthermore, Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have larger culmen depths on average.
