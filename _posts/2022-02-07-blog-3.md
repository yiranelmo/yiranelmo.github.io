title: Blog Post 3 - Web Scraping
---

In this Blog Post, I will use webscraping to answer the following question:

>
>
>What movie or TV shows share actors with your favorite movie or show?
>
>

First of all, my favorite movie is "The Godfather". The [link](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/) is the introduction of the movie in IMDB. In this movie, I like very much like the movie Michael's character Al Pacino. This [link](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/) is an introduction to the information of the actor Al Pacino.

So, in this post, I will do some web scraping around the movie "The Godfather" and the actor Al Pacino.

Please visit this [link](https://github.com/yiranelmo/web_scraping) for detailed code about this web scraping.



# Part 1: Setup



## 1.1 Locate the Starting IMDB Page

The following URL is my favorite movie "The Godfather":

```python
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/
```



## 1.2 Dry-Run Navigation

First, click on the *Cast & Crew* link. This will take you to a page with URL of the form:

```python
<original_url>fullcredits/
```

For example, the *Cast & Crew* link for the movie "The Godfather" is as follows:

```python
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/fullcredits/
```



Then, the URL of actor Al Pacino's introduction page is as follows:

```python
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/
```



## 1.3 Initialize Our Project

1. Create a new GitHub repository, and sync it with GitHub Desktop.
2. Open a terminal in the location of your repository on your laptop, and type:

```python
conda activate PIC16B
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```



## 1.4 Tweak Settings

Add the following line to the file `settings.py`:

```python
CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20 
```

This code just prevents your scraper from downloading too much data while youâ€™re still testing things out.

When we're done with all the code, we're going to remove this line of code.



# Part 2: Write Your Scraper



Create a file inside the `spiders` directory called `imdb_spider.py`. Add the following lines to the file:

```
# to run 
# scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o movies.csv

import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/']
```

Then we will write three functions in this class.

## Function 1: `parse(self, response)`

In this function, 

```python
def parse(self, response):
  """
  From the movie's main page, 
  use this function to get to the Cast & Crew page.
  ------------------------
  This function does not return any data.
  """
  
  # url is the Cast & Crew page of the movie
  url = response.url + "fullcredits"
  
  # called `parse_full_credits` function use `callback` method 
  yield scrapy.Request(url, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```



## Function 2: `parse_full_credits(self, response)`

In this function,

```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
  """
  From the Cast & Crew page, 
  this function returns a'scrapy.Request' for each actor's page.
  ------------------------
  This function does not return any data.
  """
  
  # create a list of relative paths, one for each actor
  name = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]
  
  # yield the request to next function by each actor
  for list in name:
    url = "https://www.imdb.com" + list
    yield scrapy.Request(url, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```



## Function 3: `parse_actor_page(self, response)`

In this function,

```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
  """
  From the each actor's page, 
  this function returns a dictionary for
  each of the movies or TV shows on which that actor has worked. 
  ------------------------
  This function return a dictionary.
  """
  
  # get the actors' names
  actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()
  
  # get the movies or TV shows which the actor has worked
  tv_movies = response.css("div.filmo-row b a::text").getall()

  # make the actors' names and tv_movies to a dictionary
  for i in tv_movies:
    yield {
      "actor": actor_name,
      "movie_or_TV_name": i
    }
```



# Part 3: Scraping & Recommendations



Before scraping the data, we need to remove this code line form `settings.py`:

```python
CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20
```

Then,  run the command below to create a `.csv`file with a column for actors and a column for movies or TV shows:

```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
```

After we get the scraping results, we load the `results.csv` in the Jupyter notebook.

Then I create a pandas data frame to display of the results:

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("result.csv")
df = data['Movie_or_TV_name'].value_counts().reset_index()
df = df.rename(columns={'index': 'Movie_or_TV_name', 'Movie_or_TV_name': 'number of shared actors'})
df[0:12]
```
Here is the result table:

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }
    
    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
