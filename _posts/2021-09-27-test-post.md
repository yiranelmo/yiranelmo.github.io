In this post, I will do some data visualization analysis on Palmer Penguins data.

First, Load the Palmer Penguins data 
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
Then, load other packages
```python
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

```python
df = penguins.copy()
#select more important columns
columns = ["Species", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)",
           "Body Mass (g)", "Delta 15 N (o/oo)", "Delta 13 C (o/oo)"]
dv_1 = pd.DataFrame(df, columns = columns)
dv_1.groupby(["Species", "Sex"]).mean().round(2)
```

For instance, some clear observations and patterns that we can see are:
- On average, Gentoo penguins tend to have the largest body mass and flipper length for both genders when compared to the other two species.
- Despite Gentoo penguins being the largest out of the three, the numbers suggests that they have the shortest culmen depth of the three species.
- On average, Adelie penguins are the smallest penguins with regards to body mass, flipper length, and their culmen length.

```python
# use seaborn package to create row of graphs
fgrid = sns.relplot(data = df, x = 'Body Mass (g)', y = 'Flipper Length (mm)',
hue = 'Species', col = 'Species', alpha = 0.7, aspect = 1.2, height = 4)
```

From our previous summary table, we saw that there were patterns between these two variables and so, we created these graphs to further validate those observations. These graphs show an even clearer pattern between these two quantitative varibles and suggests that on average, Adelie penguins are the smallest penguins and Gentoo penguins are the largest penguins with regards to both body mass and culmen length. From this, we can possibly assume that culmen length could be a strong predictor variable that we could use for our models later on.

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
ax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Depth (gmm)',
ylabel = 'Frequency',
title = 'Histogram of Culmen Depth')
specie = set(df['Species'])
for i in specie:
    distinct = df[df['Species'] == i]
    distinct = distinct['Culmen Depth (mm)'].dropna()
    ax.hist(distinct, label = i.split(' ')[0], alpha = 0.5)
ax.legend()
```

From the summary table, we observed that most of the Gentoo penguins had smaller culmen depths on average. Using this histogram, we can see that most of the Gentoo penguin data points lie around the lower culmen depths, which supports this observation. Culmen depth may be a strong indicator that differentiates Gentoo penguins from other species. Furthermore, Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have larger culmen depths on average.
