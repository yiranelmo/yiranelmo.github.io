title: Blog Post 4 - Spectral Clustering
---

In this blog post, we'll write a tutorial on a simple version of the *spectral clustering* algorithm for clustering data points.



# Introduction

In this problem, we'll study *spectral clustering*. Spectral clustering is an important tool for identifying meaningful parts of data sets with complex structure. To start, let's look at an example where we *don't* need spectral clustering. 

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

```python
n = 200
np.random.seed(1111)
X, y = datasets.make_blobs(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, random_state=None, centers = 2, cluster_std = 2.0)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```

*Clustering* refers to the task of separating this data set into the two natural "blobs." K-means is a very common way to achieve this task, which has good performance on circular-ish blobs like these: 

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)

plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```

# Harder Clustering

That was all well and good, but what if our data is "shaped weird"? 

```python
np.random.seed(1234)
n = 200
X, y = datasets.make_moons(n_samples=n, shuffle=True, noise=0.05, random_state=None)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1])
```

We can still make out two meaningful clusters in the data, but now they aren't blobs but crescents. As before, the Euclidean coordinates of the data points are contained in the matrix `X`, while the labels of each point are contained in `y`. Now k-means won't work so well, because k-means is, by design, looking for circular clusters. 

```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 2)
km.fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c = km.predict(X))
```

Whoops! That's not right! 

As we'll see, spectral clustering is able to correctly cluster the two crescents. In the following problems, you will derive and implement spectral clustering. 



# Part A

First, we need make a similarity matrix  `𝐀`.   `A ` should be a matrix (2d, `np.ndarray`) with shape `(n, n)`.

When constructing the similarity matrix, use a parameter `epsilon`. Entry `A[i,j]` should be equal to `1` if `X[i]` (the coordinates of data point `i`) is within distance `epsilon` of `X[j]` (the coordinates of data point `j`), and `0` otherwise. 

**The diagonal entries `A[i,i]` should all be equal to 0.** 

**Note:**  `pairwise_distances ` function from `sklearn`.   And `np.fill_diagonal()` is a good way to set the values of the diagonal of a matrix.  

```python
# try use epsilon = 0.4
epsilon = 0.4

# pairwise distances matrix of X
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances
A = pairwise_distances(X, X)

# if within distance epsilon is 1, and 0 otherwise
A[A < epsilon] = 1
A[A != 1] = 0

# set diagonal entries to 0
np.fill_diagonal(A, 0)

A
```

```python
array([[0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 1., 0.],
       ...,
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 1., 1.],
       [0., 0., 1., ..., 1., 0., 1.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 1., 1., 0.]])
```



# Part B

The matrix `A` now contains information about which points are near (within distance `epsilon`) which other points. We now pose the task of clustering the data points in `X` as the task of partitioning the rows and columns of `A`. 

Let $$d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}$$ be the $i$th row-sum of $$\mathbf{A}$$, which is also called the *degree* of $$i$$. Let $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$ be two clusters of the data points. We assume that every data point is in either $$C_0$$ or $$C_1$$. The cluster membership as being specified by `y`. We think of `y[i]` as being the label of point `i`. So, if `y[i] = 1`, then point `i` (and therefore row $$i$$ of $$\mathbf{A}$$) is an element of cluster $$C_1$$.  

The *binary norm cut objective* of a matrix $$\mathbf{A}$$ is the function 

$$N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)\equiv \mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)\left(\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)} + \frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_1)}\right)\;.$$

In this expression, 
- $$\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0, j \in C_1} a_{ij}$$ is the *cut* of the clusters $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$. 
- $$\mathbf{vol}(C_0) \equiv \sum_{i \in C_0}d_i$$, where $$d_i = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij}$$ is the *degree* of row $$i$$ (the total number of all other rows related to row $$i$$ through $$A$$). The *volume* of cluster $$C_0$$ is a measure of the size of the cluster. 

A pair of clusters $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$ is considered to be a "good" partition of the data when $$N_{\mathbf{A}}(C_0, C_1)$$ is small. To see why, let's look at each of the two factors in this objective function separately. 


#### B.1 The Cut Term

First, the cut term $$\mathbf{cut}(C_0, C_1)$$ is the number of nonzero entries in $$\mathbf{A}$$ that relate points in cluster $$C_0$$ to points in cluster $$C_1$$. Saying that this term should be small is the same as saying that points in $$C_0$$ shouldn't usually be very close to points in $$C_1$$. 

Write a function called `cut(A,y)` to compute the cut term. You can compute it by summing up the entries `A[i,j]` for each pair of points `(i,j)` in different clusters. 

There is a solution for computing the cut term that uses only `numpy` tools and no loops. However, it's fine to use `for`-loops for this part only -- we're going to see a more efficient approach later. 


```python
def cut(A,y):
    total_cut = 0
    
    
    for i in range(len(y)):
        for j in range(len(y)): 
            if y[i] == 0 and y[j] == 1: #
                total_cut += A[i][j] # 
                
    return(total_cut)

cut(A, y)
```

```python
13.0
```

Compute the cut objective for the true clusters `y`. Then, generate a random vector of random labels of length `n`, with each label equal to either 0 or 1. Check the cut objective for the random labels. You should find that the cut objective for the true labels is *much* smaller than the cut objective for the random labels. 

This shows that this part of the cut objective indeed favors the true clusters over the random ones. 

```python
random = np.random.randint(2, size = n)
cut(A, random)
```

```python
1150.0
```



#### B.2 The Volume Term 

Now take a look at the second factor in the norm cut objective. This is the *volume term*. As mentioned above, the *volume* of cluster $$C_0$$ is a measure of how "big" cluster $$C_0$$ is. If we choose cluster $$C_0$$ to be small, then $$\mathbf{vol}(C_0)$$ will be small and $$\frac{1}{\mathbf{vol}(C_0)}$$ will be large, leading to an undesirable higher objective value. 

Synthesizing, the binary normcut objective asks us to find clusters $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$ such that:

1. There are relatively few entries of $$\mathbf{A}$$ that join $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$. 
2. Neither $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$ are too small. 

Write a function called `vols(A,y)` which computes the volumes of $$C_0$$ and $$C_1$$, returning them as a tuple. For example, `v0, v1 = vols(A,y)` should result in `v0` holding the volume of cluster `0` and `v1` holding the volume of cluster `1`. Then, write a function called `normcut(A,y)` which uses `cut(A,y)` and `vols(A,y)` to compute the binary normalized cut objective of a matrix `A` with clustering vector `y`. 

***Note***: No for-loops in this part. Each of these functions should be implemented in five lines or less. 


```python
def vols(A, y):
    v0 = A[y == 0].sum()
    v1 = A[y == 1].sum()
    return(v0, v1)
```

Now, compare the `normcut` objective using both the true labels `y` and the fake labels you generated above. What do you observe about the normcut for the true labels when compared to the normcut for the fake labels? 


```python
def normcut(A, y):
    v0, v1 = vols(A, y)
    norm_result = cut(A, y) * (1 / v0 + 1 / v1)
    return(norm_result)
```


```python
normcut(A, y)
```
